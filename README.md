# EELS-background-subtraction-in-MATLAB
Background fitting and subtraction of electron energy loss spectra in MATLAB version R2019b.
These scripts can be applied to core and low loss EELS as well as vibrational data.
The EELS_fitting.m script surveys what the best window for fitting might be and what model should be used for the fit.
The EELS_subtracted_spectrum.m script allows assessment of the goodness-of-fit using a specific window and model.
The EELS_subtracted_spectrum.m script was written for newer users of MATLAB to plot the subtracted spectrum and 
allows users to save the subtracted spectrum as a .txt for plotting in other software.

Please see https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2020.113052 for the article describing these scripts as well as examples that use this background subtraction method.
